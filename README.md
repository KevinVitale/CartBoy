# CartKit
`CartKit` is a companion framework, used by _CartBoy_, that
defines general device support and functionality.

#### `SerialDevice<GBxCart>`
The `SerialDevice<GBxCart>` is the cart reader device from
`insidgeGadgetsController` that is capable of the following:

 - Reading the cartridge header; and,
 - copying the cartridge ROM; and,
 - backing up save data (if supported); and,
 - restoring save data (if supported); and,
 - deleting save data (if supported); and,
 - flashing new ROMs to compatible cartridges; and,
 - erasing existing ROMs from compatrible cartridges.

A `SerialDevice<GBxCart>` cannot be instantiated directly; instead
use `open` on `GBxCart` and you'll receive an isntance.

##### Read cartridge header
Simply `open` a `SerialDeviceSession`, then read the `header`
(checking the `Result`):

```swift
GBxCart.open { serialDevice in
  switch serialDevice.header(forPlatform: GameboyClassic.self) {
  case .success(let header) :print(header)
  case .failure(let error)  :print(error)
  } 
}

```

##### Copy a cartridge's ROM
Some functions let you get updates on the progress of an operation
(such as when copying a cartridge to your Mac). In these cases **you
must call the operation from queue other than the main one**.

If you omit providing a progress callback, the operation blocks the
main thread; this maybe useful for a number of scenarios (such as unit
tests).

```swift
GBxCart.open { serialDevice in
  switch serialDevice.readClassicCartridge(progress: { print($0) }) {
  case .success(let cartridge) :print(cartridge.header)
  case .failure(let error)     :print(error)
  }
}
```
