# CartKit
`CartKit` is a companion framework, used by _CartBoy_, that
defines general device support and functionality.

#### `CartridgeController`
The `CartridgeController` protocol is adopted by a device (such
as `insidgeGadgetsController`) that is capable of the following:

 - Reading the cartridge header; and,
 - copying the cartridge ROM; and,
 - backing up save data (if supported); and,
 - restoring save data (if supported); and,
 - deleting save data (if supported); and,
 - flashing new ROMs to compatible cartridges; and,
 - erasing existing ROMs from compatrible cartridges.

A `CartridgeController` performs its functions from a `perform` 
block (which runs on its own `DispatchQueue`); devices cannot
be instantiated directly, thus the `perform` block is passed the
result of a controller that can be used.

##### Read cartridge header
Simply `flatMap` a `controller` into the `header` function, and
check the `Result`.

```swift
// Note: `perform` block is performed on a separate queue.
insideGadgetsController.perform { controller in
	switch controller.flatMap({ $0.header(for: GameboyClassic.self) })	
	{
		case .success(let header): (/* do something w/header */)
		case .failure(let error):  (/* handle error */)
	}
}
```

##### Copy cartridge ROM
Similarly, to copy a cartridge's ROM to your Mac, `flatMap`
the `controller` into the `cartridge` function‚Äîwhich also
includes a callback updating the __progress__‚Äîand check the
`Result`.

```swift
// Note: `perform` block is performed on a separate queue.
insideGadgetsController.perform { controller in
	switch controller.flatMap({ $0.cartridge(for: GameboyClassic.self, progress: { print($0) }) })
	{
		case .success(let cartridge): (/* do something w/cartridge */)
		case .failure(let error):  (/* handle error */)
	}
}
```
